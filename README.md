# React/Typescript/Webpack Todo app

This is a test project to try out some new js frameworks that I've not tried before.

May extended it to try using some LocalStorage & WebSocket functionality later on.

## Installation

Install [Webpack](http://webpack.github.io/docs/installation.html) and [Webpack dev server](http://webpack.github.io/docs/webpack-dev-server.html) as global dependencies on your system.

```shell
yarn global add webpack webpack-dev-server
```

Install the local dependencies with:

```shell
yarn
```

Then you can run the dev server with:

```shell
webpack-dev-server
```

or run a one off build with:

```shell
webpack
```

The app can be loaded by opening the index.html file in the root of the repository.
