# React/Typescript/Webpack Todo app

This is a test project to try out some new js frameworks that I've not tried before.

May extended it to try using some LocalStorage & WebSocket functionality later on.

## Installation

Install [Webpack](http://webpack.github.io/docs/installation.html) and [Webpack dev server] as global dependencies on your system.

```shell
yarn global install webpack webpack-dev-server
```

Then you can run the dev server with

```shell
webpack-dev-server
```

or run a one off build with

```shell
webpack
```
